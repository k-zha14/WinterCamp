* [**Assignment1 Decision Tree**](https://github.com/k-zha14/WinterCamp/tree/master/Assignment1_DecisionTree)  
> In this project, [Wiscosin Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) dataset is loaded. After coding a CART decision tree by hand, I compare the test result with the BenchMark, a [CART](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) established by scilearn-kit toolbox.   
And the final accuracy is 0.88849(5-fold cv, by Me) V.s 0.91742(scilearn-kit), which is pretty close.
